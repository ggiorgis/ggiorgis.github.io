I am a `Research Associate` at the [Grothendieck Institute](https://igrothendieck.org/en/), working on the project Implementing Structural and Toposic Ideas into Artificial Intelligence. I am supervised from [Laurant Lafforgue](), [Olivia Caramello]() and [Aurelian Sagnier](). I am also affiliated with the `Lagrange Mathematics and Computing Research Center`, where I spend most of my research time. My work aims to explore how tools from category theory, topos theory, and structural mathematics can enrich the foundations of machine learning and provide new ways to think about abstraction, reasoning, and representation.

I completed my Master’s degree in Mathematics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I wrote my thesis under the supervision of [Helmut Bölcskei](https://www.mins.ee.ethz.ch/index.html). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at the `University of Turin`, completing my thesis with [Susanna Terracini](). During my undergraduate studies, I was also an Honorary Allievo at the [Collegio Carlo Alberto](), where I earned a diploma in `Applied Mathematics and Economics`. Prior to my current position, I worked as a `Research Assistant` at the `KOF Lab` at `ETH Zurich`.

My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics and machine learning. I am fascinated by the fundamental questions of learning and intelligence, how systems represent structure, acquire knowledge, and reason about the world, and I am motivated by the idea that deeper mathematical frameworks may provide new answers to these questions.
